<h2>What is Music Therapy?</h2>
Music therapy is the application of music to aid in the achievement of specific therapeutic goals.
 Music therapy can also be defined as the planned and creative use of music to attain and maintain health and well being.
  Music therapy is an established health service similar to occupational therapy and physical therapy.
   As a holistic treatment approach, music therapy focuses on the well being of the entire person,
    not just the part which is diseased or in distress.

<h3>Why Music Therapy?</h3>
Music therapy is a cost-effective therapy that really works! It is effective in meeting the physical, psychological, cognitive, social, and spiritual needs of the people it serves. Music therapy has been proven effective by hundreds of scientific research studies and articles, and by centuries of use in cultures throughout the world. Music therapy has also been shown to have physiological effects on heart-rate, blood pressure, immune system responses, and neurological function.
Human beings are musical creatures. Rhythm is a concept we share with all life and with the complex forces that govern our existence. Biological patterns range from simple rhythms, such as the heart beat, to the complex rhythms of the nervous system. Vibration is also a universal constant, from the vibrations of atoms and molecules that make up all matter, to the cosmic echo of the "big bang" which still exists even today.
For thousands of years, healers across the earth and in every culture have used music as a healing tool. Indigenous peoples of Africa, Asia, North and South America, and Australia have all used music in their medicine practices. A 20,000-year-old hieroglyph in a cave in France proves that music has also been used to heal in ancient European cultures: It is a picture of a shaman holding a medicine rattle. Music is an effective tool to help reduce physical, emotional, and spiritual stress and pain. It can also offer unique insights to the human experience.
